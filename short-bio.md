<h2>My Interests</h2>
I am foremost a Christian -- Evangelical by denomination. I believe that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God; that the world and man were created in six days by God; that man, preferring his to will to that of his creator, chose to sin against God, causing a separation between God and man; that Jesus Christ, the Son of God -- divine by nature -- died for every person's sins, so that we might not fall under eternal condemnation separated from the Lord, but rather have eternal life with Him; and that Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, will rule in Jerusalem for 1000 years with the saints, fulfilling his promises to Israel: that David would never lack a son to rule after him.
