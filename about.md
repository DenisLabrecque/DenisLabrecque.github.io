headline: Denisâ€™ Blog was first begun as a work tool to organize my collection of musical compositions. That goal having been met, I rapidly added to the original idea.

That happened especially because I was having fun making myself a site. As inspiration I had a second-hand volume from the author David Seigel called Creating Killer Websites. After many trials, and after having taught myself the HTML and CSS languages using that volume, I created this site. All that, I undertook without having access to the web, but as a personal project that I would make public on the long term.

The 27th of January 2014, Daniel Dastoor helped me much by creating a trial site version on the web. Since then, I have been working at it and attempting to make it as functional as possible.

My website used to be SinedVille.tk (by reversing *Denis* as *Sined* and using the French *Ville* to mean *City*). As I found that name inconvenient, I finally bought my own domain name under the <code>.ca</code> extension. It went through many permutations as I constantly added changes. My first design was classic and oriented on my four-square teal-blue-and-brown-coloured logo.

My second design was heavily inspired by the new Windows 8 look and its so-called *Metro* flat style.

It also had a style selector for changing the page style from anything like more conventional white look to a green-and-yellow handwritten variation." %}

For a while, I toyed with WordPress, renaming my blog DenisHub. However, because of complications with using two languages, and because of the dissatisfactory slowness of the platform as well as its lack of flexibility, that solution became dissatisfactory.

After considering how to host my website on the long term, I chose <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_new">GitHub Pages</a>, which should provide a stable, free host for years to come. Using GitHub means my website is written in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_new">Jekyll,</a> a flat-file templating language that greatly simplifies site-wide modifications and supports markup as a bonus. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sylvaindurand/jekyll-multilingual" target="_new">Sylvain Durand</a> and his <a href="https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/" target="_new">article on making Jekyll multilingual</a> from which this site is pulled.
