headline: DenisLabrecque.ca was first begun as a work tool to organize my collection of musical compositions. That goal having been met, I rapidly added to the original idea.

That happened especially because I was having fun making myself a site. As inspiration I had a second-hand volume from the author David Seigel called Creating Killer Websites. After many trials, and after having taught myself the HTML and CSS languages using that volume, I created this site. All that, I undertook without having access to the web, but as a personal project that I would make public on the long term.

The 27th of January 2014, Daniel Dastoor helped me much by creating a trial site version on the web. Since then, I have been working at it and attempting to make it as functional as possible. Just to give you an idea, a year later, I am making a third revision of this site, complete with new styles and easier to use (and also hopefully the last revision). Because Sinedville has gone through so many changes, and because the content is not always ready or well identified, I apologise for any flagrant mistakes, tentative text, or broken links.

My website used to be SinedVille.tk (by reversing *Denis* as *Sined* and using the French *Ville* to mean *City*). As I found that name inconvenient, I finally bought my own domain name under the <code>.ca</code> extension.

My website went through many permutations as I constantly added changes. My first design was classic and oriented on my four-square teal-blue-and-brown-coloured logo.

My second design was heavily inspired by the new Windows 8 look and its so-called *Metro* flat style.

It also had a style selector for changing the page style from anything like more conventional white look to a green-and-yellow handwritten variation." %}
