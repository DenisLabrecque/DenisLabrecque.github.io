You should consider hiring me because I learn well on my own; for example, I taught myself violin playing, musical composition, and web design; this shows capacity to work alone. I am also perseverant, and strive to be always truthful.

If you have an opportunity for me, I am thankful for it. I will come curious about how you do things, open-minded, ready to learn, and ready to work for your needs.

If you do not have an opportunity at the moment, thank you still for your kind attention. Please do keep my contact information if you believe such an opportunity will arise later!

<li>{% include cite.html title="Bachelor’s Degree in Computer and Information Sciences" description="“In PCC’s computer information systems major, students prepare for a variety of industry positions by learning to plan, program, and manage computer information systems, networks, databases, and websites. Students receive hands-on experience in a broad range of technologies and programming languages, gaining the logical thinking and disciplined documentation necessary to work with computer information systems.
Because the emphasis is on programming, students learn computer languages such as Java, COBOL, HTML, JavaScript, and SQL, with optional electives providing experience in PHP and other languages. Students also receive database, networking, and computer hardware experience. In the capstone course, Systems Design, students collaborate to develop a small business computer application from the initial design stage to final implementation.”" href="http://www.pcci.edu/academics/divisions/professionalstudies/business/ComputerInformationSystems.aspx" date="January 22, 2017" %}</li>
  
<h6>Mobile Programming</h6>
Developed for Android using Java and C#, programmed a cross-platform application, assessed the feasibility of creating a new realty application, and worked both alone and in a team according to the model-view-controller pattern.
<h6>.NET Programming</h6>
Created Universal Windows Platform applications in C# using the .NET framework.
<h6>Object-oriented Programming and Design</h6>
Examined and understood the principles of objet-oriented programming in C++ when evaluated according to severe guidelines and capacity to follow a rigid format.
<h6>Computer Graphics Programming</h6>
Created computer games in teams using Unity, and assessed topics such as 2D sprites, 3D modelling, animation, shaders, and QBasic.

<li>{% include cite.html title="Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Design" description="“Commercial advertising/graphic design firms, businesses, and Christian ministries need creative and efficient designers who can produce clear, visual communication using advanced technology. With abundant hands-on instruction, students begin by developing fundamental drawing and design skills using traditional media, while also learning essential computer application skills using Apple iMac computers and Adobe® Creative Cloud software. Advanced training in creative problem solving, as well as two semesters each of web design and multimedia production, helps fully prepare students to design practical, useful solutions to common graphic problems.
The program includes internships in the field and courses to develop digital portfolios and self-promotional materials for potential employers. With the senior portfolio exhibit, students complete the program and showcase their best work.”" href="http://www.pcci.edu/academics/divisions/visualandperformingarts/visualarts/GraphicDesign.aspx" date="January 22, 2017" %}</li>


<h6>Graphic Design I & II</h6>
Exercised problem-solving skills while creating logos and combination marks, a company identity, vector illustrations, brochures, and food packaging, along with other regular assignments.
<h6>Principles of Painting</h6>
Learned to paint realistically in watercolour, acrylic, and mixed media.
<h6>Principles of Drawing</h6>
Used pencil to draw realistically and learn visual modelling, shading, and proportion. Extreme scrutiny in correct values and exact negative space.
</ul>


<p>These two degrees are in progress at Pensacola Christian College, Florida. In my concentration, I have followed courses on programming, in graphic production software, in drawing, and in painting. Studying in a rule-strict environment allowed me to adapt to life on campus, to follow a regular schedule, and to keep a regular performance. I am presently in my junior year, each semester being completed with Dean’s list honours.</p>-->
