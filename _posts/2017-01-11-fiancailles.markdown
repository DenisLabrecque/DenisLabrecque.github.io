<p class="coralie-texting">Quand j'ai vu Denis pour la premi√®re fois, je soupais √† Varsity (une de nos deux salles √† manger) avec ma coloque Olivia et une autre amie. Cet amie a dit, "Ne regarde pas maintenant, mais il est juste l√†!" Elle soupira ensuite d'admiration.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">Je me suis tourn√©e bri√®vement pour voir de qui elle parlait, et Olivia guida mes yeux vers le "bel homme aux cheveux de flamme." Je ne me suis pas souci√©e de regarder pour longtemps. Ce "bel homme" √©tait assis avec quelques filles, et les filles avec lesquelles j'√©tais semblaient vouloir les joindre. Cela m'ennuyait.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">Olivia m'expliqua ensuite qui Denis √©tait: un artiste, un Canadien, et son compagnon de chapelle (selon les si√®ges d√©sign√©s). Elle sugg√©ra que, vu le fait que j'√©tais aussi canadienne, je devrais devenir amie avec lui. "Jamais," je lui r√©pliquai. "J'ai des amis. Je n'ai pas besoin d'en avoir plus."</p>

<h4>Parade of Nations</h4>
<h5>February 13, 2016</h5>
<p><em>We met.</em></p>
We both first met at Pensacola Christian College during the practice day for Parade of Nations, an missions-oriented event which underlines the international attendance at PCC. As each nationality represented was placed in a separate separate row of seats, the whole Canadian group sat together. As we were a couple of seats across, we got to see each other a little and spoke briefly.

<p class="coralie-texting">I have learned that whenever I say "never," God changes my heart towards that idea I am so opposed to. The change started a few weeks later in the Visual and Performing Arts Center.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">One evening, Denis and I happened to be drawing in the same classroom. As I walked about the room, perusing the works-in-progress of my peers, I noticed Denis's drawing of a beetle. I found his attention to detail remarkable, and started to feel some respect for him as an artist.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">This was the incident which prompted me to introduce myself to Denis at the rehearsal for the Parade of Nations. In fact, my first words to him were, "You are taking art classes, correct?"</p>

<p class="denis-texting">She spoke fluent French and was born in Qu√©bec, which was quite exceptional.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">However, though I certainly realized she was pretty, I didn't know her personally, and therefore didn't think more of it. But I did make the smart move of offering to take a picture of our group and text it to everyone. I thereby harvested each person's number, including Coralie's.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">--- Your first impressions ---</p>

Our first text was therefore very simple. It just contained a few pictures of our group, with the name of the picture-taker:

That was it! At that time, Coralie was a Sophomore at PCC, and Denis was a second-semester Freshman. See us in the picture?

Roses:
Velvet kisses
Gently caress my soul.
Hoping, daring, reassuring&mdash;Loving.</p>
