This painting was my first serious stab at watercolour. In class, we received the option of painting either a deer or a turkey. Because most students chose the deer, I picked the turkey.

After a couple hours of first drawing outlines, the design was ready to be transferred lightly to watercolour paper and painted. I first began with the black highlights; then, following an application of yellow, the other pigments were added on gradually, ending finally in the fruits, leaves, and plate of the outer edge.

In my rendition, I was careful to proceed slowly and attempted to capture the original photograph in the best way possible. One surprise to me in painting was how -- though one might think a simple chunk of meat plain -- many bright reds, oranges, and yellows were necessary to reproduce the image accurately.

For the skill level required overall, though certainly not perfect, this painting did very well -- and even surprised me somewhat.
