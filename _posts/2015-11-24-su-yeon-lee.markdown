In AR 111 at Pensacola Christian College, one of our projects was to draw either an animal or a portrait. As I thought portraits more valuable, I chose to draw one, but hesitated on who to draw. As time grew late, my decision was to get <a href="http://denislabrecque.ca/artwork/2015/11/28/rhinoceros-beetle.html">an easy image reference of a beetle</a> approved before obtaining the actual image.

Finally, I decided that instead of drawing family and people I knew, I would draw someone totally different. At that time, as seating in New Testament class was in alphabetical order (Lee following Labrecque), there was a Korean student I had briefly met who sat on beginning of the next row. Though extremely apprehensive about asking to draw a near stranger, I gathered up my courage and did so, thinking I might as well try. To my surprise, she noted my internet profile and accepted to send me potential reference images.

Unfortunately, none of the pictures could be accepted having the correct detail and shadow for drawing. Nevertheless, because of my promise, I chose to continue anyway, using my backup beetle image for the actual project. This allowed me to use the whole 14 by 17-inch size of my paper, instead of being obliged to create a 2-inch border all around.

Though the challenge of drawing from a difficult reference photograph made me press on, obtaining the correct proportions on such a large format as compared to the original made the task tough. Additionally, the mouth's countours were very hard to find, and adding shadow and keeping the eyes large but still accurate was arduous for me. In fact, because the semblance is difficult to judge by the draft, I scrapped my initial drawing and rendered a second one after a second draft.

Among the drawing's successes were artistically amplifying a grainy image while portraying equal-to or larger-than life, and rendering light reflections through the hair and on the skin. But the hair might be rendered more realistically, and the chin, overlapped by the hand, seems misaligned relative to the mouth.
