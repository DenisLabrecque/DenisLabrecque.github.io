<p class="coralie-texting">The first time I saw Denis, I was having supper at Varsity (one of our two dining halls) with my roommate Olivia and one of her friends. This friend said, "Don't look now, but there he is!" She proceeded to sigh, adoringly.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">I briefly turned to see whom she was speaking of, and Olivia guided my gaze to the "fine-looking man with flaming red hair." I didn't care to look for long. This "fine man" was sitting with several girls, and the girls with whom I was sitting seemed to want to join them. That annoyed me.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">Olivia then explained to me who Denis was: an artist, a Canadian, and her favourite chapel buddy. She suggested that, seeing as I was a Canadian, too, I should befriend him. "Never," I replied. "I have friends. I don't need more."</p>

<h4>Parade of Nations</h4>
<h5>February 13, 2016</h5>
<p><em>We met.</em></p>
We met at Pensacola Christian College during the practice day for Parade of Nations, an missions-oriented event which underlines the international attendance at PCC. As each nationality represented was placed in a separate separate row of seats, the whole Canadian group sat together. As we were a couple of seats across, we got to see each other a little and spoke briefly.

<p class="coralie-texting">I have learned that whenever I say "never," God changes my heart towards that idea I am so opposed to. The change started a few weeks later in the Visual and Performing Arts Center.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7f/d6/76/7fd6765b6c1e35b38a2920ceff0d0517.jpg">One evening, Denis and I happened to be drawing in the same classroom. As I walked about the room, perusing the works-in-progress of my peers, I noticed Denis's drawing of a beetle. I found his attention to detail remarkable, and started to feel some respect for him as an artist.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">This was the incident which prompted me to introduce myself to Denis at the rehearsal for the Parade of Nations. In fact, my first words to him were, "You are taking art classes, correct?"</p>

<p class="denis-texting">She spoke fluent French and was raised in Qu√©bec, which was quite exceptional.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">However, though I certainly realized she was pretty, I didn't know her personally, and therefore didn't think more of it. But I did make the smart move of offering to take a picture of our group and text it to everyone. I thereby harvested each person's number, including Coralie's.</p>

Our first text was therefore very simple. It just contained a few pictures of our group, with the name of the picture-taker:

<p class="denis-texting"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1b/4b/89/1b4b898d9c09b4531672c535f1ee9148.jpg" />Hi from Denis Labrecque</p>

From that time on, we knew each other casually, but never met between groups. However, we both happened to be in the habit of eating breakfast very early in Four Winds, at a similar spot.

<p class="denis-texting">At that time, I tried to get in touch with a few people who could speak French, so I could keep in touch with my home identity; this allowed me to meet another Canadian friend, and a few Hatians.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">I did notice Coralie's breakfast spot, and thought it would be great to get to know her; so I texted her, asking whether she would want to have breakfast together and speak French.</p>

<p class="denis-texting">From the first couple of days we ate together, I quickly evaluated Coralie, and discounted her because our life plans were not likely to match, and because her character was somewhat more extremely orderly and proper than mine.</p>

<p class="coralie-texting">During those first few weeks of getting to know Denis, I didn't consider him as a potential life partner. Though other girls found him attractive, I wasn't particularly drawn; my vision was set on my plans for the future, and I could see nothing else. That was ironic, considering that the handsome man sitting across from me at breakfast WAS my future.</p>

<p class="coralie-texting">Another incident changed my view of Denis‚Äîand like the last, it occurred at the VPA. As I was searching for the electric eraser one afternoon, I met Denis in the hallway. I told him that I was looking for the eraser, and continued on. Just as I was about to leave, unsuccessful in my search, Denis appeared with the electric eraser in hand. He had found it for me. Until that point, I had regarded him as a nice person, but this "chivalrous" act elevated him in my esteem. His act of kindness set him apart.</p>

<p class="coralie-texting">From that incident onward, my sentiments toward him rapidly evolved. I didn't recognize my feelings until my roommate Olivia elicited them from me. We were finishing supper at Four Winds when I noticed Denis sitting alone a few tables away. We joined Denis at his table and I began chatting with him in French, while Olivia listened, though our conversation was incoherent to her. Olivia and I departed, and on our way out, she commented, "Marry the boy. He's the nicest man, and you guys are cute when you talk in French." "Well, tell HIM that." My impulsive reply surprised both me and Olivia. She had made her comment somewhat in jest, and though I had tried to answer likewise, I unwittingly answered in earnest. "So," Olivia began, thoughtfully, "you do like him?" I paused, contemplating my feelings. With a shrug, I then confessed: "Yes."</p>

<p class="denis-texting"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f4/52/de/f452de2dfa1cb2c2d480db27394b0e85.jpg" />I sneaked this picture of Coralie at our breakfast table üòâ</p>

<p class="denis-texting">The two following semesters, I attempted to date someone; that finally did not work out. Coralie and I did, however, continue to have breakfast together every now and then, as friends.</p>

<h4>Harmonious Strings of S√£o Paulo</h4>
<h5>October 8, 2016</h5>
<p><em>Our first event together.</em></p>
The first few weeks of the school year, we went to church together a couple of times. However, there were some struggles.
<p class="coralie-texting">I had resolved at the beginning of the semester to be Denis's friend.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">When in line for lunch, I mentioned I had no plans for Fine Arts: Olivia was almost offended. "Go out with Coralie!" she said.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">So far, I had resisted the idea, because I didn't want to give off the impression I wanted a relationship. Even, someone else had asked me whether Coralie was available for Fine Arts, and I had already honestly declared having no intention to invite her.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">However, thinking about it more, to attend with a friend who actually enjoyed classical music seemed far more interesting, rather than&mdash;alone.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">Because I had been having a bad week, Olivia decided to tell me that Denis was going to ask me to Fine Arts.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">So I asked to meet Coralie, and invited her to come with me.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">She made me repeat.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">Straight away, she whipped out her attendance card and gave it to me.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">Xxx</p>

<p class="denis-texting"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f2/00/08/f200080ba0ebe9f2ad6b66ca4df55334.jpg" />Is she not pretty? üòç<br />Yes, I innovated and created a special flower holder for the event. It's from a foam model jet.</p>

<p class="denis-texting"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/39/d3/37/39d337f6742add2b5086aacec4692e1f.jpg" />We had a wonderful evening together at the Concert at the Green.<br />Coralie gave me some of her pizza, and let me drink from her cup, which was very cute.</p><!-- 28 october 2016 -->

<h4>Palms Grille</h4>
<h5>November 14, 2016</h5>
<p><em>We almost broke up.</em></p>
President Shoemaker gave us a few dollars to spend at Palms Grille that semester. We went that Sunday evening.
<p class="denis-texting">As we were eating, I grilled Coralie about understanding God's will, especially at her wanting to go to Hungary. How, I asked, would she know something like that for certain, if God didn't speak to her directly.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">That had been on my mind for a long time, and in relation, I affirmed, "we've been hanging out too much lately." "Our paths are not convergent: therefore, so that this doesn't get even more difficult for you, and so you can pursue the life goals you have chosen, I don't think it's right to continue leading you on."</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">"But I also need to correct you on this one point: I never said that our paths were irreconcilable. In fact, that is the very opposite of what I believe. I believe in a God of the impossible Who reconciles the irreconcilable, Who plans that two incredibly similar people of the same nationality, with agreeing philosophies, and with the same interests, should meet at the same place at the same time, a time when they both needed such a meeting. I took a chance on you because I was wholly convicted that my God's favourite pastime is to perform miracles, small and large. I was so confident that I never thought of taking that chance as taking a risk. There are no risks in trusting God. Maybe I was‚Äîand still remain‚Äînaive to believe in all of that. But the Lord has always carried out His Will in my life through miracles in the past; consequently, it's difficult for me to give up on you so easily. You were one of God's miracles in my life‚Äîand you had become my new dream."</p>
 <p class="coralie-texting">"I was stubborn in letting you into my life, and I will be equally stubborn in letting you go. But because I love you and care more about what is best for you, I will not let my stubbornness get in the way of respecting your convictions or your need for distance. Of course, you can still have confidence that I won't turn you away if you ever need a friend to confide in. But I won't cling to you, even if my heart does."<p>

<p class="denis-texting">The force of feelings took me by surprise. I didn't expect she'd be so attached. After talking to my mother over the phone and considered how those things happened, I could understand Coralie's train of thought better. But I still wasn't sure what to do.</p>
 <p class="denis-texting">I was honest, and did write, "don't give up on me. This morning, as chapel interrupted my writing you, I fell in tears over the song
<br />   <q>As the deer panteth for the waters
<br />    So my soul longeth after thee;
<br />    You alone are my heart's desire...</q>
<br />Hopefully you don't feel the need to distance yourself too much."

<h4>Taking a Chance</h4>
<h5>November 17, 2016</h5>

<p class="denis-texting">As a reconciliation, I took a recent watercolour post card project, stuffed my Fine Arts ticket and my Thanksgiving dinner attendance card into it, and sent it up to Coralie's room with red roses through her rommate Olivia. Inside the card was written
<br /><q>I'll take a risk
<br />Or two.</q></p>

<p class="coralie-texting"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/cb/91/3c/cb913c756e983fcb2122c7ad63b01972.jpg" />*The Gift*
<br />Roses:
<br />Velvet kisses
<br />Gently caress my soul.
<br />Hoping, daring, reassuring&mdash;Loving.</p>
