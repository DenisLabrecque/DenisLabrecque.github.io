      description: Part of the problems of developing a jet-powered hovering aircraft is heat buildup. Although 26% shielded by heat-resistant titanium, graphite, and composites, the aircraft could not safely hover for more than 2¬Ω minutes due to heat limitations.

<p class="coralie-texting">The first time I saw Denis, I was having supper at Varsity (one of our two dining halls) with my roommate Olivia and one of her friends. This friend said, "Don't look now, but there he is!" She proceeded to sigh, adoringly.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">I briefly turned to see whom she was speaking of, and Olivia guided my gaze to the "fine-looking man with flaming red hair." I didn't care to look for long. This "fine man" was sitting with several girls, and the girls with whom I was sitting seemed to want to join them. That annoyed me.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">Olivia then explained to me who Denis was: an artist, a Canadian, and her favourite chapel buddy. She suggested that, seeing as I was a Canadian, too, I should befriend him. "Never," I replied. "I have friends. I don't need more."</p>

<h4>Parade of Nations</h4>
<h5>February 13, 2016</h5>
<p><em>We met.</em></p>
We met at Pensacola Christian College during the practice day for Parade of Nations, an missions-oriented event which underlines the international attendance at PCC. As each nationality represented was placed in a separate separate row of seats, the whole Canadian group sat together. As we were a couple of seats across, we got to see each other a little and spoke briefly.

<p class="coralie-texting">I have learned that whenever I say "never," God changes my heart towards that idea I am so opposed to. The change started a few weeks later in the Visual and Performing Arts Center.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7f/d6/76/7fd6765b6c1e35b38a2920ceff0d0517.jpg">One evening, Denis and I happened to be drawing in the same classroom. As I walked about the room, perusing the works-in-progress of my peers, I noticed Denis's drawing of a beetle. I found his attention to detail remarkable, and started to feel some respect for him as an artist.</p>
<p class="coralie-texting">This was the incident which prompted me to introduce myself to Denis at the rehearsal for the Parade of Nations. In fact, my first words to him were, "You are taking art classes, correct?"</p>

<p class="denis-texting">She spoke fluent French and was born in Qu√©bec, which was quite exceptional.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">However, though I certainly realized she was pretty, I didn't know her personally, and therefore didn't think more of it. But I did make the smart move of offering to take a picture of our group and text it to everyone. I thereby harvested each person's number, including Coralie's.</p>

Our first text was therefore very simple. It just contained a few pictures of our group, with the name of the picture-taker:

<p class="denis-texting"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1b/4b/89/1b4b898d9c09b4531672c535f1ee9148.jpg" />Hi from Denis Labrecque</p>

From that time on, we knew each other casually, but never met between groups. However, we both happened to be in the habit of eating breakfast very early in Four Winds, at a similar spot.

<p class="denis-texting">At that time, I tried to get in touch with a few people who could speak French, so I could keep in touch with my home identity; this allowed me to meet another Canadian friend, and a few Hatians.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">I did notice Coralie's breakfast spot, and thought it would be great to get to know her; so I texted her, asking whether she would want to have breakfast together and speak French.</p>

<p class="denis-texting">From the first couple of days we ate together, I quickly evaluated Coralie, and discounted her because our life plans were not likely to match, and because her character was somewhat more extremely orderly and proper than mine.</p>
<p class="denis-texting">The two following semesters, I attempted to date someone; that finally did not work out. Coralie and I did, however, continue to have breakfast together every now and then, as friends.</p>

<p class="coralie-texting">---- After this, I needed emotional support -----</p>

Roses:
Velvet kisses
Gently caress my soul.
Hoping, daring, reassuring&mdash;Loving.</p>
