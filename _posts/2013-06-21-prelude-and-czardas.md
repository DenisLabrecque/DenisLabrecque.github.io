    notes: Before making this composition, I had often contemplated creating a czardas. Indeed, since quite early in my learning the violin, I had become familiar with the score of the very famous Czardas for violin and piano by Vittorio Monti. I told myself that if many people enjoy his composition, it would be profitable to make one of the same kind. I therefore consulted our Encyclopedae Brittanica, and was easily relate what was mentioned there to what I knew of a czardas, and could see that such a project was within my reach.
Later, I decided to make it a composition for my friend Daniel. I therefore began by the lassu (Andante Maestoso), of which the composition method was somewhat unusual:
I wished, for the lassu, to create a soft and melodic entry for the entry of the violin. I therefore wrote, out of my first inspiration, a line for the cello, containing an element of danse and a fragment of melody. After further consideration, I found that beautiful, but not sufficient. I therefore added a line for the clarinet, which I though would then carry the melody: false! I would end up creating a new line for the flute, that one finally being beautiful and satisfying. 
To introduce the czardas, I chose a theme invented earlier through a creative spinoff for the Various Airs, opus 25. That then became the theme of the ad perpetuum of the first movement. That perpetual movement is in reality an interrupted flow, since it stops in its center for a short Moderato, before starting again, on a new tone which makes these three parts—the Vivace of the beginning, the Moderato which follows, and the Vivace or A tempo of the end—inseperable.
