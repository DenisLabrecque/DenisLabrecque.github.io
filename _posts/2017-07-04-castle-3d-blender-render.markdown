This render, made in Blender 3D software, took about three days to create. It was inspired by a previous pencil sketch, and its goal was to create a night scene with an imaginary house-sized castle to be illuminated on a river island. The goal is to create a short movie with  shimmering water and changing lights, as the moon crosses the sky overhead.

The terrain was sculpted and simplified Dissolve. Then, to that terrain a weighted particle system was added with 2D planes of tree pictures with an alpha channel. The water uses the Ocean modifier set to a high resolution to simulate smaller waves. The trees in the forefront were created in higher detail using the Sapling Tree Gen add-on. They are illuminated by specially modeled exterior spotlights.
