This render, made in Blender 3D software, took about three days to create. It was inspired by a previous pencil sketch, and its goal was to create a night scene with an imaginary house-sized castle to be illuminated on a river island. The goal is to create a short movie with  shimmering water and changing lights, as the moon crosses the sky overhead.

The terrain was sculpted and simplified Dissolve. Then, to that terrain a weighted particle system was added with 2D planes of tree pictures with an alpha channel. The water uses the Ocean modifier set to a high resolution to simulate smaller waves. The trees in the forefront were created in higher detail using the Sapling Tree Gen add-on. They are illuminated by specially modeled exterior spotlights.

Blender (a free and open source 3D creation suite) rendered this scene after all night using the Cycles engine set at 1024 samples.
