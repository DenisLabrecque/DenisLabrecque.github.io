Based on Psalm 32, this song was written both as a reminder to continually seek the Lord's forgiveness and to have joy in it. This composition originated to be sung for the Campus Church at Pensacola Christian College.

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<ul class="poetry">
<li>Many deceits, hiding, weighed on me,
<br />Pressing on my shoulders heavily;
<br />Speaking through my silence words untold,
<br />Making what was hidden grow so bold.</li>

<li>Shadows mark the place of what is old:
<br />Why let sin envelop with its mold?
<br />Shackles are the price of slavery:
<br />Why forget the work of Calvary?</li>
</ul>

<ul class="poetry">
<li><i>Sins forgiven
<br />We are bidden
<br />To walk holy
<br />For Thee.</i></li>

<li><i>Tear now apart the sin ensnaring me so easily, that now I might declare Your wonders; O&hellip;</i></li>
</ul>

<ol class="composition-lyrics">
<li>Blessed are the just, those (who walk) pure in Your sight!
<br />Covered by Thy might,
<br />Walking by Thy sight,
<br />They stand upon a solid height.
<br />Renew us all so (we might) stay on the way!
<br />Steadfast ev’ry day,
<br />Keeping time to pray:
<br />Our God, let no one fall away.</li>

<li>Are you made clean, one (who walks) pure in His sight?
<br />Are you in His light,
<br />Covered in His sight?
<br />Do you stand on a solid height?
<br />Are you renewed, made (wholly) clean each new day?
<br />Walking in the way,
<br />Keeping time to pray?
<br />Our God, let no one fall a way.</li>
</ol>

<ul class="poetry">
<li>All who are forgiven stand in joy;
<br />Heaven given mercies they employ,
<br />Praises of thanksgiving they proffer
<br />Walking in their God, their deliv’rer.</li>

<li>Turning towards Him, they do not hide:
<br />Hiding from their sin is not their pride.
<br />On their shoulders nothing: all is light;
<br />On their heart no blemish: all is white.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="poetry">
<li><i>Holy, 
<br />Living purely
<br />By forgiveness
<br />In righteousness:
<br />As such make me
<br />Pure and holy.
<br />Keep me closely
<br />To be more like Thee.</i></li>
</ul>
