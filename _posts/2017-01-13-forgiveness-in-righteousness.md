Based on Psalm 32, this song was written both as a reminder to continually seek the Lord's forgiveness and to have joy in it. This composition originated to be sung for the Campus Church at Pensacola Christian College. 

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<ol class="composition-lyrics">
<li>Many deceits, hiding, weighed on me,
<br />Pressing on my shoulders heavily;
<br />Speaking through my silence words untold,
<br />Making what was hidden grow so bold.</li>

<li>Shadows mark the place of what is old:
Why let sin envelop with its mold?
Shackles are the price of slavery:
Why forget the work of Calvary?</li>

<li>Sins forgiven
We are bidden
To walk holy
For Thee.</li>

<li>Tear now apart the sin ensnaring me so easily, that now I might declare Your wonders; O...</li>
</ol>

<ol class="composition-lyrics">
<li>Blessed are the just, those (who walk) pure in Your sight!
<br />Covered by Thy might,
<br />Walking by Thy sight,
<br />They stand upon a solid height.</li>

<li>Renew us all so (we might) stay on the way!
Steadfast ev’ry day,
Keeping time to pray:
Our God, let no one fall away.</li>

<li>Are you made clean, one (who walks) pure in His sight?
Are you in His light,
Covered in His sight?
Do you stand on a solid height?</li>

<li>Are you renewed, made (wholly) clean each new day?
Walking in the way,
Keeping time to pray?
Our God, let no one fall a way.</li>
</ol>

All who are forgiven stand in joy;
Heaven given mercies they employ,
Praises of thanksgiving they proffer
Walking in their God, their deliv’rer.

Turning towards Him, they do not hide:
Hiding from their sin is not their pride.
On their shoulders nothing: all is light;
On their heart no blemish: all is white.

Holy, 
Living purely
By forgiveness
In righteousness:
As such make me
Pure and holy.
Keep me closely
To be more like Thee.
