    notes: "<p>This composition is truly a <i>prelude and czardas,</i> in the same way as a <i>toccata and fugue.</i> The prelude, being in quasi-perpetual motion, is, in that sense, the toccata. Earlier, this composition was called Daniel II, but because the name seemed redundant and could be confused with the earlier <i>Varia Daniel,</i> I dropped it in favour of the more semantic title <i>Prelude and Csárdás.</i></p>"
  - title: Csárdás

    notes: "<p>Before making this composition, I had often contemplated creating a csárdás. Indeed, since quite early in my learning the violin, I had become familiar with the score of the very famous <i>Csárdás</i> for violin and piano by Vittorio Monti. I told myself that if many people enjoy his composition, it would be profitable to make one of the same kind. I therefore consulted our <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> to find out what could be known about that form of music.</p><p>Later, I decided to make it a composition for my friend Daniel. I therefore began by the lassu <i>(Andante Maestoso),</i> of which the composition method was somewhat unusual:</p><p>I wished, for the <i>lassu,</i> to create a soft and melodic entry for the entry of the violin. I therefore wrote, out of my first inspiration, a line for the cello, containing an element of danse and a fragment of melody. After further consideration, I found that beautiful, but not sufficient. I therefore added a line for the clarinet, which I though would then carry the melody: false! I would end up creating a new line for the flute, that one finally being beautiful and satisfying.</p><p>To introduce the csárdás, I chose a theme invented earlier through a creative spinoff for the <!--<a href='{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2013-01-01-various-airs %}'>--><i>Various Airs</i> for violin. That then became the theme of the <i>ad perpetuum</i> of the first movement. That perpetual movement is in reality an interrupted flow, since it stops in its center for a short <i>Moderato,</i> before starting again, on a new tone which makes these three parts—the <i>Vivace</i> of the beginning, the <i>Moderato</i> which follows, and the <i>Vivace</i> (or <i>A tempo</i>) of the end—inseperable.</p>"
