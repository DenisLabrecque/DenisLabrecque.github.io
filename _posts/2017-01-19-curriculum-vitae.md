  <h4>Secondary Studies</h4>
  <h5>A Beka Academy</h5>
  <p>These general studies in English, mathematics, and the humanities prepared me for university by giving me a mastery of the basic subjects with a global comprehension of the sciences and of the world.</p>

<h5>{% include cite.html title="Bachelor’s Degree in Computer and Information Sciences" description="“In PCC’s computer information systems major, students prepare for a variety of industry positions by learning to plan, program, and manage computer information systems, networks, databases, and websites. Students receive hands-on experience in a broad range of technologies and programming languages, gaining the logical thinking and disciplined documentation necessary to work with computer information systems.
Because the emphasis is on programming, students learn computer languages such as Java, COBOL, HTML, JavaScript, and SQL, with optional electives providing experience in PHP and other languages. Students also receive database, networking, and computer hardware experience. In the capstone course, Systems Design, students collaborate to develop a small business computer application from the initial design stage to final implementation.”" href="http://www.pcci.edu/academics/divisions/professionalstudies/business/ComputerInformationSystems.aspx" date="January 22, 2017" %}</h5>
<h5>{% include cite.html title="Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Design" description="“Commercial advertising/graphic design firms, businesses, and Christian ministries need creative and efficient designers who can produce clear, visual communication using advanced technology. With abundant hands-on instruction, students begin by developing fundamental drawing and design skills using traditional media, while also learning essential computer application skills using Apple iMac computers and Adobe® Creative Cloud software. Advanced training in creative problem solving, as well as two semesters each of web design and multimedia production, helps fully prepare students to design practical, useful solutions to common graphic problems.
The program includes internships in the field and courses to develop digital portfolios and self-promotional materials for potential employers. With the senior portfolio exhibit, students complete the program and showcase their best work.”" href="http://www.pcci.edu/academics/divisions/visualandperformingarts/visualarts/GraphicDesign.aspx" date="January 22, 2017" %}</h5>
