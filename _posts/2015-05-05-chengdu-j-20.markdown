The J-20 is a Chinese stealth fifth-generation multirole air superiority fighter planned to be operational in 2018. Its design is characterised by a set of canards and by the omission of a gun, which does not seem to be provided for. Half a dozen prototypes have been produced, the maiden flight having been held in January 2011.

China's J-20 platform has the potential to be a capable, long-range strike system in the Asia-Pacific region, but a number of technical challenges will need to be overcome before production can begin.
