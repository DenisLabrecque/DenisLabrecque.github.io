This modular poster is designed to be placed at the Scale Air exposition building in Montreal. Because each branded hoodie sale is sponsored by Revell and Motion RC, the poster’s goal is to get visitors to the hoodie kiosk, where the sponsorship information will be revealed. To target patrons interested in aviation, this poster appeals to their sense of flying away. Additionally, to maximize audience comprehension, the ad is bilingual, as is common around Montreal. This poster will help raise visitor awareness of the hoodie booth at the Scale Air exposition.
