The J-20 is a Chinese stealth fifth-generation multirole air superiority fighter planned to be operational before 2020. Its design is characterised by a set of canards and by the omission of a gun, which does not seem to be provided for. Half a dozen prototypes have been produced, the maiden flight having been held in January 2011.
