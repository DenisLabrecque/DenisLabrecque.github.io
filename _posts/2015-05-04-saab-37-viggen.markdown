The Viggen (Thunderbolt) was developed by Sweden in the mid-1950s as a fighter and attack plane which could take off and land from specially prepared roads without the maintenance highly trained personnel, with the additional capacity of reaching Mach 1 at low altitude and Mach 2 at high altitudes. A delta-winged design with aiding canards was therefore selected, allowing operations within 500 m airstrips. The turbofan engine, selected for fuel economy, was quite particular, being one of few which featured an afterburner and mechanical thrust-reverser combination; it was also unusually large (6.1 m x 1.35 m). Produced in 329 units, the Viggen remained operational until 2007.

<h3>Characteristics</h3>

<strong>Maximum speed:</strong> Mach 2.1, 2,231 km/h (1,386 mph) at 11,000 m<br />
<strong>Range:</strong> 2,000 km internal fuel only (1242 mi)
