This painting was my first serious stab at watercolour. In class, we received the option of painting either a deer or a turkey. Because most students chose the deer, I picked the turkey.

In my rendition, I was careful to proceed slowly and attempted to capture the original photograph in the best way possible. One surprise to me was how many bright colours were necessary to reproduce the image. Overall, for the skill level required, this painting did very well, and even surprised me somewhat.
