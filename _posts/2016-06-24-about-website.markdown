headline: Denis&apos; Blog was first begun as a work tool to organize my collection of musical compositions. That goal having been met, I rapidly added to the original idea.

That happened especially because I was having fun making myself a site. As inspiration I had a second-hand volume from the author David Seigel called Creating Killer Websites. After many trials, and after having taught myself the HTML and CSS languages using that volume, I created this site. All that, I undertook without having access to the web, but as a personal project that I would make public on the long term.

The 27th of January 2014, Daniel Dastoor helped me much by creating a trial site version on the web. Since then, I have been working at it and attempting to make it as functional as possible.

My website used to be SinedVille.tk (by reversing *Denis* as *Sined* and using the French *Ville* to mean *City*). As I found that name inconvenient, I finally bought my own domain name under the <code>.ca</code> extension. It went through many permutations as I constantly added changes. My first design was classic and oriented on my four-square teal-blue-and-brown-coloured logo.

It also had a style selector for changing the page style from anything like more conventional white look to a green-and-yellow handwritten variation." %}
</div>

My second design was heavily inspired by the new Windows 8 look and its so-called *Metro* flat style.

For a while, I toyed with WordPress, renaming my blog DenisHub. However, because of complications with using two languages, and because of the dissatisfactory slowness of the platform as well as its lack of flexibility, that solution became dissatisfactory.

After considering how to host my website on the long term, I chose <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_new">GitHub Pages</a>, which should provide a stable, free host for years to come. Using GitHub means my website is written in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_new">Jekyll,</a> a flat-file templating language that greatly simplifies site-wide modifications and supports markup as a bonus. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sylvaindurand/jekyll-multilingual" target="_new">Sylvain Durand</a> and his <a href="https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/" target="_new">article on making Jekyll multilingual</a>, from which this site is pulled.



<h3>About me</h3>
I was born in Sorel-Tracy, Québec, Canada, and was raised in Granby, where my father worked as an engineer. From there, we moved to the small village of St-Denis-sur-Richelieu, where we stayed all my teen years.

I was homeschooled until university, learning English and French natively. I am now a student in university at Pensacola Christian College, and work during the summers.

<h4>My Interests</h4>
<h5>Beliefs</h5>
I am foremost a Christian -- Evangelical by denomination. I believe that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God; that the world and man were created in six days by God; that man, preferring his to will to that of his creator, chose to sin against God, causing a separation between God and man; that Jesus Christ, the Son of God -- divine by nature -- died for every person's sins, so that we might not fall under eternal condemnation separated from the Lord, but rather have eternal life with Him; and that Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, will rule in Jerusalem for 1&thinsp;000 years with the saints, fulfilling his promises to Israel: that David would never lack a son to rule after him.

<h6>Political</h6>
I am a strong believer in a free economy and low taxation, or, in other words, conservative politics. My concern is that our earnings, instead of being spent by us, are spent by the country for other people's interests in a centralized policy that is not tailored to best suit our personal needs and encourages only what the government thinks best. Although taxation is necessary, it should be limited to what is absolutely necessary for the entire community.

<h5>Pastimes</h5>
Although I do appreciate many styles of music, my favourite is classical for its complexity. I especially enjoy Baroque fugue music and vocal motets, as well as violin concertos and organ toccatas. I enjoy composing classical music as well, and do play the violin and piano.

I also enjoy drawings and paintings, and do create my own too. One of my personal <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/DenisGLabrecque/beautiful-paintings/" target="_new">favourite paintings</a> is probably <em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/460211655654242611/" target="_new">Man with Cat</a></em> by Cecilia Beaux.

Computer code, especially when it includes graphic elements -- such as in the case of this website, which I myself built from scratch -- also occupies some of my time. Such is the reason I am studying Computer Information Systems and Grahpic Design at the same time.

I'm also an aviation enthusiast, and especially appreciate jet airplanes of any kind. Rencently, I have delved into the hobby of remote control electric ducted fan foam airplanes, and am loving it!

In general though, I just like making stuff. Furniture, clothes, websites, illustrations, music, literature, gardens -- it doesn't matter.

<h3>What is this Website about?</h3>
<p><strong>This site is my virtual portfolio.</strong> I have worked countless hours making musical compositions, drawings, short books and articles that I wish to share with you.</p><p><strong>It is also a sounding board</strong> to the defense of the truth and the life, found in Jesus-Christ, the God of Heaven and the Saviour of our evil actions. And He is the Word, and His word is the Bible (John 1).</p><p>The news following the Bible's veracity is this — as the Christ the Messiah has said, “He that overcomes shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.” It therefore follows that “He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.”</p><p>Because of this knowledge, I also have an interest in apologetics and in the question of origins. I have hence written out my reflection on the question of origins, named <a href='http://denislabrecque.ca/step-by-step-towards-the-truth.html'><em>Step by Step Towards the Truth</em></a>, in which I expound the logical path taken in the discovery of my Lord.</p>
