One main project produced for Pastor Berkey was the design of 115&nbsp;000 summer flyers, to be distributed in town by the summer missionaries. There were quite a few boxes of these!

First, I produced a few options from which to chose; then, with additional input from the staff, a final design was agreed upon. Because none of my original four designs were accepted, this took some back and forth: good practice in understanding and executing a boss' concept.

At last, once the choice of a front image was narrowed down to a drink, I could easily focus on the final result. The tracts were then sent to print through GotPrint, making this a great experience with ordering from an outside printing company.

Another interesting set of projects was making flyers announcing church activities. There were quite a few of these, which had to be printed sporadically according to necessity. Because of this, I adopted a similar design for each, hunting down an appropriate background image each time. Some of these were translated into Spanish, which was a great localization experience.

Some of my work was providing posters for events. In this, it was necessary to follow the general style and fonts set by the previous designer. Some of the largest posters were printed in large format and hung on the school walls, while others were meant for screen display.

Part of the church activities was Southwest Junior youth camp. This was the occasion of a fun pamphlet design.

As part of the youth program, much of my time was spent working on promotional materials and verse workbooks for the students of Camp Liberty. This permitted my learning of the Xerox printer, especially since a new one was installed after my arrival: I was the one to figure out how to debug it. This also allowed me to print over 900 copies of booklets, folded and stapled by the printer.

Finally, I got a request from First Choice to design a billboard according to an idea given me. I had no idea whether it will actually be displayed, and don't know its exact final size, but it was an interesting project. If anyone sees it, please send me a picture!

That pretty much wraps up the highlights of my internship work at Liberty!
