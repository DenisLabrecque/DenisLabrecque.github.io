Following our <a href="http://denislabrecque.ca/artwork/2015/11/23/shawn-labrecque.html">first portrait</a>, a requirement of AR&nbsp;111 was to draw either a new portrait or an animal. Although my choice was to create a portrait, my photo reference was not accepted, and I <a href="http://denislabrecque.ca/artwork/2015/11/24/su-yeon-lee.html">drew the portrait on the side.</a>

An attractive part of the reference is the blurr going towards the background. Another interesting feature to draw was the enameled look. Combined with the shadows, these gave the drawing a great sense of perspective.

As it turned out, apart from the too blurry foot beneath the mouth, this drawing impressed my teacher, who gave me an A+ with the remark that drawing insects seemed to be my thing. I, however, decided that it suffered too much from paper-grain-speckle sickness, which I resolved to get rid of in the future by layering lighter pencils before adding the darker colours.
