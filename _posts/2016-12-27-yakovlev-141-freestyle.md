The Yakovlev-141 (or Yak-41) was meant to replace the Yakovlev-38 Forger, a subsonic aircraft of slightly less performance than its equivalent Western counterpart, the Harrier. These Soviet aircraft were designed for the air defense of the fleet, to be based on Kiev-class heavy aviation cruisers. The Kiev ships were designed as smaller fixed-wing aircraft carriers, as the project of building supercarriers such as those of the United States was considered less cost effective by the Soviet Navy.

One crucial improvement to the Forger's design was the Yak-41's ability to sustain continued supersonic flight. This, and other improvements, aimed at 

Part of the problems of developing a jet-powered hovering aircraft is heat buildup. Although 26% shielded by heat-resistant titanium, graphite, and composites, the aircraft could not safely hover for more than 2½ minutes due to heat limitations.
