<p>This game's idea is to imitate electric ducted fan jets, simulating what a dogfight in them would be like if they were equipped with laser pointers as score-counting technology and miniature compressed-air missiles that follow their target by following the sounds the target emits.</p>

<p>This simulator allows you to shoot your enemy over a LAN or internet network using a radio-controlled airplane that contains an automatically aiming laser.</p>

<p>Be sure to exercise power management, as flying at maximum throttle will have a battery impact. Shooting the laser will remove all power from your opponent. However, it must be aimed within an acceptable radius forwards.</p>
