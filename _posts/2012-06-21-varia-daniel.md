      notes: "<p>I had the pleasure of assisting to the closing concert of the String Quartet Academy of McGill with the Dastoor family. That happened the 26 and 27th of August 2011, very precisely. My friend Daniel Dastoor studied at McGill at that time, and for that reason, with assisted the concert freely. As we discussed during the intermission, we mentioned the Chaconne by J. S. Bach (with which Daniel had already won a contest), and he told me: You should also compose a chaconne for solo violin, exactly like Bach s: super long and super difficult. You should really compose one! I kept that in mind.</p><p>I put myself to work later on, and created lines which did not at all displease me. However, the bass soon became a stumbling block, and I stopped from fear of having to start all over.</p>"

      notes: "<p>In the meantime, I wished to create a quite rapid and catchy melody, but which was not too difficult. I realised the need for that sort of simple and comprehensible piece more and more since Grandpa Labrecque asked me to play violin during our visits at his place. I took out a flute movement in that goal—it had originally been planned as a movement of a concerto—and fixed and improved it.</p>"
