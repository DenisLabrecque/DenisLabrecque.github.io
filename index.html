   <h3>Programming and Graphic Design</h3>
   <p>Instilled with a passion to create, I taught myself web programming&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;all without the internet! That same interest has led me to pursue two baccalaureates: one to exercise logic, and the other to exercise inventiveness. Throughout university-level studies, I have maintained high academic standing in both design and computer science.</p>
